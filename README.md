# Protest-Riot Classifier

A Convolutional Neural Network that classifies images as riots or protests. The idea for this project originally came after the storming of the capitol on January 6, 2021. The question of whether Trump incited an illegal riot got me thinking. Can we use technology or scientific standards to define the difference between a protest and a riot? 


This CNN was trained on the Bing Image results for "protest" and "riot" search queries. It was built with the [fast.ai](docs.fast.ai) libary. It is not meant to indicate with any "correctness" whether an event is actually a protest or a riot. My hope is that it gives insight into the ways we (the internet people) already do talk about protests and riots. 


The final project **[GeorgeFloyd.pdf](https://github.com/ollycohen/riot_classifier/blob/main/GeorgeFloyd.pdf)** uses photos from [After the Death of George Floyd: Voices Behind the Most Powerful Protest Photos](https://time.com/5844377/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-photos/).
